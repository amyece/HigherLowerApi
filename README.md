# HigherLowerApi

This is the API for the Higher Lower Card Game Task.

Please run this API alongside the HigherLowerGUI for the fullstack application to work.

**IMPORTANT: CORS policy means GUI port must be http://localhost:4200 for the API to work.**

In my local settings this API is ran on https://localhost:7014, if you need to change this please refer to *game.service.ts* in the GUI project, you will find the Api URL, you can then edit the port number accordingly.


I opted for the API approach for this coding task, mainly because I wanted to test myself with fullstack development. When approaching this task the Api endpoints were relatively obvious so it made sense to go down this route. This way, the project will be easy to build upon, and more time would allow further endpoints to enhance gameplay.
