# HigherLowerApi

This is the API for the Higher Lower Card Game Task.

Please run this API alongside the HigherLowerGUI for the fullstack application to work.

IMPORTANT: CORS policy means GUI port must be http://localhost:4200 for the API to work.

In my local settings this API is ran on https://localhost:7014 so this is what the GUI will connect to.
