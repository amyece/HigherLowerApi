# HigherLowerApi

This is the API for the Higher Lower Card Game Task.

Please run this API alongside the HigherLowerGUI for the fullstack application to work.

**IMPORTANT: CORS policy means GUI port must be http://localhost:4200 for the API to work.**

In my local settings this API is ran on https://localhost:7014, if you need to change this please refer to *game.service.ts* in the GUI project, you will find the Api URL, you can then edit the port number accordingly.
